# A folder for Opencv-python basics
A code implement of https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o
Huge thanks toward FCC group and youtuber himself. 
I wrote code along with this video, aimed to get familiar with common opencv methods.
And hope I could have some scratch to review when working with opencv in the future.
If anyone found this repo, hope it could help you too and forgive my shitty code.
